# Sitecore.Support.94870.118509
The `SPEAK Select Media` dialog box doesn't use the `Root` field value which is defined in any item (e.g. `AllMediaFiles`) under the `/sitecore/client/Applications/Dialogs/SelectMediaDialog/PageSettings/SearchConfigs/AllMediaFiles` item in the `Core` database.</br>
This patch fixes the described behavior.
